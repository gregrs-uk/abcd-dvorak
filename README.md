# ABCD text files

This repository contains a text file for each lesson in Dan Wood's [ABCD Dvorak Typing Course](http://gigliwood.com/abcd/). This should make it easier to import the lessons into typing tutor applications such as [TIPP10](http://www.tipp10.com). Please visit [Dan's website](http://gigliwood.com/abcd/) for further information, licence terms and updates.
